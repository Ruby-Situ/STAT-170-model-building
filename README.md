This is my individual portion of a group project. Done in R using R studio. 

It goes in this order with each file making new changes to the model before finally deciding on my final one.

1: climate eda.Rmd
2: RubySitu_ModelBuilding
3: week9

The model makes a lot of transformations to the variables like centering, boxcox transformations, and interactions.

The assesments were done using model summaries, two way anovas, variance inflation factor to deal with multicollinearity, and visual assements using graphs.
